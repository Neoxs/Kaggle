## About this Course
In this course, you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.  At the end of the first course you will have studied how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, you will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:<br>
   - Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  
   - Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.
   - Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
   - Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
   - Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
   - Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
   - Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
   - Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
   - Implement these techniques in Python.
